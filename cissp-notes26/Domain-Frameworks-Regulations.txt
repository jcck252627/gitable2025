Framework and Compliance lists:

 COBIT 2019: 
 COBIT, which stands for Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies, is primarily a framework focused on governance and management of enterprise IT. Although COBIT can help organizations align IT with business strategies and manage IT-related risks, 
 COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)
 
Business-focused IT governance framework.
Aligns IT goals with business objectives and risk management.
  Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)
 SOX

HIPAA
**HIPAA = Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996)**
**HIPAA establishes a framework for protecting health information, and its enforcement is carried out by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Health and Human Services (HHS). OCR is responsible for enforcing the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, conducting compliance reviews, and investigating complaints. HHS, on the other hand, is involved in developing and updating HIPAA regulations and ensuring equal access to health and human services. 

**From a CISSP perspective, HIPAA is: ✔ A U.S. federal law protect­ing PHI, Protected Health Information (PHI) includes:
	-Medical records
	-Billing data
	-Diagnoses
	-Lab results
	-Any data that can identify a patient
**HIPAA aligns to the “C” in GRC — Compliance.

A law with three major rules the exam focuses on:
**Privacy Rule** – defines when PHI can/cannot be used or disclosed
**Security Rule** – protects electronic PHI (ePHI) via administrative, physical, and technical controls
**Breach Notification Rule** – requires timely disclosure to affected individuals + HHS (US Department of Health and Human Services)
**Covered entities:** (hospitals, insurers, clinics, providers, plans, clearinghouses, doctors, pharmacies)
**Business associates:** (cloud vendors, billing companies, MSPs, labs) - any person/org/services that works with entities that handles PII/PHI

✔Privacy Rule...
		- Governs: Use & disclosure of PHI, Minimum necessary requirement, Patient rights (access, correction, restrictions)
		**CISSP mindset: Privacy Rule = policy & governance.

✔ Security Rule 
		**Requires administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for ePHI:
		**Administrative Safeguards
		-	Risk assessments
		-	Workforce training
		-	Policies/program oversight
		**Physical Safeguards
			Facility access
			Device/media controls
		**Technical Safeguards
		-	Access control
		-	Audit logs
		-	Encryption (addressable, not mandatory)
		-	Integrity controls
		**CISSP mindset: Security Rule = technical + operational security controls.**	
✔ Breach Notification Rule ...If PHI is breached:
		-	Notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay
		-	Notify HHS
		-	Notify media if > 500 individuals affected
		**	CISSP mindset: Breach = immediate reporting + incident response. CISSP will NEVER choose “wait for investigation to complete before notifying.”
How CISSP Wants You to Think About HIPAA
Use these principles:
✔ Compliance requirements override convenience
✔ Patient rights and privacy always come first
✔ Administrative controls are equally important
✔ Risk assessment is the foundation of HIPAA Security Rule
✔ Breach notification must be prompt
✔ PHI = highly regulated, no exceptions
 
 PCI DSS
 COBIT -	 COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) is a framework developed by ISACA for IT management and governance. It's a toolset that allows managers to bridge the gap between control requirements, technical issues, and business risks. It's the correct answer in this case because one of the objectives of COBIT is to help businesses create optimal value from IT by maintaining a balance between realizing benefits and optimizing risk levels. Therefore, it can be used for self-directed risk management.

 address other aspects of data privacy, such as the need for user consent for data collection, limits on data retention, and the right to erasure. Creating a public-facing privacy policy that is easy to understand and accessible is a good practice for transparency and can help customers understand how their PII is used, but this does not necessarily ensure the company is adhering to the strict privacy standards required by law, particularly in regions like the EU
 
 ITIL
 
COSO Internal Control Framework
Focuses on enterprise internal controls and risk management.
Often referenced for financial systems and compliance.


SOC 1 / SOC 2 (AICPA)/SOC3 / each with type 1/2
**SOC = System and Organization Controls.. They are audits performed under AICPA SSAE 18 standards.
** AICPA = American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Auditing Standards Board.
**SOC reports are third‑party independent audits
**They support **vendor due diligence, supplier risk, and compliance assurance**
**SOC is NOT security certification (they are attestation, not certification)
**SOC reports are a GRC artifact, not a technical control
**Type 1 - A point in time report ... completedthe first time to get SOC certification ... “Are the controls designed properly now?”
**Type 2 - conducted annually , show how controls operated over a period of time typically 6-12 months ... “Do the controls actually work during this period?” ... **CISSP perferred type 2 for RMF** 

➡	SOC 1 = FINANCIAL
	Sections: 1. Auditor’s Report / 2. Management Assertion / 3. System Description/ 4. Control Objectives (financial oriented)/ 5. Controls and Tests / 6. Results / Exceptions
	CISSP GRC Tie‑Ins:  Vendor financial risk, Third‑party assurance, Governance requirements for financial systems, SOX compliance evidence

➡➡SOC 2 = SECURITY .............**MOST important for CISSP**
Purpose
Evaluate controls relevant to the Trust Services Criteria (TSC):
Regular testing and monitoring of controls are the most important elements of a successful SOC 2 audit. The SOC 2 (Service Organization Controls 2) report focuses on an organization's non-financial reporting controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a system. To satisfy the requirements of SOC 2, an organization must demonstrate that it has suitable controls in place and that they are operating effectively over time.

➡ SOC 3 = PUBLIC‑FACING SECURITY SUMMARY
Purpose
A public, high-level version of SOC 2 with no confidential details.
Used For
Marketing
Publishing on website
Easy proof of security posture
CISSP GRC Tie‑In:  Used for governance transparency and stakeholder assurance, but not acceptable for vendor risk assessments.

SOC 1 is Financial reporting controls (ICFR) for Auditors, CFO, regulators
SOC 2 focuses on security, availability, confidentiality, integrity, privacy. need registered CPA firms/CPAs to conduct audits and issue reports for **security and customer teams** ....
SOC 3 for Public summary of SOC 2 for giving to Public, marketing, customers

 SOC 1 vs SOC 2
Your organization is evaluating a payroll vendor that processes financial transactions. Which report provides the MOST relevant assurance?
✔ Correct Answer: SOC 1 Type II
➡ CISSP Logic:
Financial reporting = SOC 1.
Assurance = Type II.
 
 CISSP Exam Traps to Avoid
❌ Trap 1: “SOC 1 is about security”
No — SOC 1 = financial.
❌ Trap 2: “SOC 3 is enough for due diligence”
Never. It is not acceptable for risk assessments.
❌ Trap 3: “Type I is as strong as Type II”
Type II is always stronger.
❌ Trap 4: “SOC reports certify security”
They do not certify. They attest.
❌ Trap 5: “SOC 2 always includes all TSC”
Only Security is mandatory.

The SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls) audit is a type of audit designed to assess a service organization's systems in terms of their security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. 
The primary focus of a SOC 2 audit is on the **organization's non-financial reporting controls** as they relate to the **security and availability** of a system. 
These controls must be designed effectively and operating as intended to pass the audit.

System Organization Controls (SOC) reports
Over the years, audit standards have evolved and matured over the years from SAS70 → SSAE 16 → SSAE 18.

The SSAE 18 standard defines three types of Service Organization Controls (SOC) reports:

SOC 1 reports are quite basic and focus on financial reporting risks.
SOC 2 reports are much more involved and focus on the controls related to the five trust principles: security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, and privacy.
SOC 3 reports are stripped-down versions of SOC 2 reports—typically used for marketing purposes.
There are also two types of SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports:

A Type 1 report focuses on the design of controls at a point in time.
A Type 2 report examines not only the design of a control but, more importantly, the operating effectiveness over a period of time, typically a year.
From the types of reports defined, it should be clear that SOC 2, Type 2 are the most desirable reports for security professionals, as they report on the operating effectiveness of the security controls at a service provider over a period of time.
 
 
 The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (Common Criteria or CC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for computer security certification
