Framework and Compliance lists:

 COBIT 2019: 
 COBIT, which stands for Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies, is primarily a framework focused on governance and management of enterprise IT. Although COBIT can help organizations align IT with business strategies and manage IT-related risks, 
 COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)
 
Business-focused IT governance framework.
Aligns IT goals with business objectives and risk management.
  Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)
 SOX

HIPAA
**HIPAA = Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996)**
**HIPAA establishes a framework for protecting health information, and its enforcement is carried out by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Health and Human Services (HHS). OCR is responsible for enforcing the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, conducting compliance reviews, and investigating complaints. HHS, on the other hand, is involved in developing and updating HIPAA regulations and ensuring equal access to health and human services. 

**From a CISSP perspective, HIPAA is: ✔ A U.S. federal law protect­ing PHI, Protected Health Information (PHI) includes:
	-Medical records
	-Billing data
	-Diagnoses
	-Lab results
	-Any data that can identify a patient
**HIPAA aligns to the “C” in GRC — Compliance.

A law with three major rules the exam focuses on:
**Privacy Rule** – defines when PHI can/cannot be used or disclosed
**Security Rule** – protects electronic PHI (ePHI) via administrative, physical, and technical controls
**Breach Notification Rule** – requires timely disclosure to affected individuals + HHS (US Department of Health and Human Services)
**Covered entities:** (hospitals, insurers, clinics, providers, plans, clearinghouses, doctors, pharmacies)
**Business associates:** (cloud vendors, billing companies, MSPs, labs) - any person/org/services that works with entities that handles PII/PHI

✔Privacy Rule...
		- Governs: Use & disclosure of PHI, Minimum necessary requirement, Patient rights (access, correction, restrictions)
		**CISSP mindset: Privacy Rule = policy & governance.

✔ Security Rule 
		**Requires administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for ePHI:
		**Administrative Safeguards
		-	Risk assessments
		-	Workforce training
		-	Policies/program oversight
		**Physical Safeguards
			Facility access
			Device/media controls
		**Technical Safeguards
		-	Access control
		-	Audit logs
		-	Encryption (addressable, not mandatory)
		-	Integrity controls
		**CISSP mindset: Security Rule = technical + operational security controls.**	
✔ Breach Notification Rule ...If PHI is breached:
		-	Notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay
		-	Notify HHS
		-	Notify media if > 500 individuals affected
		**	CISSP mindset: Breach = immediate reporting + incident response. CISSP will NEVER choose “wait for investigation to complete before notifying.”
How CISSP Wants You to Think About HIPAA
Use these principles:
✔ Compliance requirements override convenience
✔ Patient rights and privacy always come first
✔ Administrative controls are equally important
✔ Risk assessment is the foundation of HIPAA Security Rule
✔ Breach notification must be prompt
✔ PHI = highly regulated, no exceptions
 
 PCI DSS
 COBIT -	 COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) is a framework developed by ISACA for IT management and governance. It's a toolset that allows managers to bridge the gap between control requirements, technical issues, and business risks. It's the correct answer in this case because one of the objectives of COBIT is to help businesses create optimal value from IT by maintaining a balance between realizing benefits and optimizing risk levels. Therefore, it can be used for self-directed risk management. 
 
 The COBIT framework is structured in a hierarchical manner, with governance being the top level and representing the overall strategic direction, decision-making, and monitoring mechanisms for the organization's information technology. It provides oversight, strategic direction, and accountability mechanisms, and it ensures the alignment of the organization's IT strategy with its broader business strategy.

 address other aspects of data privacy, such as the need for user consent for data collection, limits on data retention, and the right to erasure. Creating a public-facing privacy policy that is easy to understand and accessible is a good practice for transparency and can help customers understand how their PII is used, but this does not necessarily ensure the company is adhering to the strict privacy standards required by law, particularly in regions like the EU
 
 ITIL
 
COSO Internal Control Framework
Focuses on enterprise internal controls and risk management.
Often referenced for financial systems and compliance.


SOC 1 / SOC 2 (AICPA)/SOC3 / each with type 1/2
**SOC = System and Organization Controls.. They are audits performed under AICPA SSAE 18 standards.
** AICPA = American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Auditing Standards Board.
**SOC reports are third‑party independent audits
**They support **vendor due diligence, supplier risk, and compliance assurance**
**SOC is NOT security certification (they are attestation, not certification)
**SOC reports are a GRC artifact, not a technical control
**Type 1 - A point in time report ... completedthe first time to get SOC certification ... “Are the controls designed properly now?”
**Type 2 - conducted annually , show how controls operated over a period of time typically 6-12 months ... “Do the controls actually work during this period?” ... **CISSP perferred type 2 for RMF** 

➡	SOC 1 = FINANCIAL
	Sections: 1. Auditor’s Report / 2. Management Assertion / 3. System Description/ 4. Control Objectives (financial oriented)/ 5. Controls and Tests / 6. Results / Exceptions
	CISSP GRC Tie‑Ins:  Vendor financial risk, Third‑party assurance, Governance requirements for financial systems, SOX compliance evidence

➡➡SOC 2 = SECURITY .............**MOST important for CISSP**
Purpose
Evaluate controls relevant to the Trust Services Criteria (TSC):
Regular testing and monitoring of controls are the most important elements of a successful SOC 2 audit. The SOC 2 (Service Organization Controls 2) report focuses on an organization's non-financial reporting controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a system. To satisfy the requirements of SOC 2, an organization must demonstrate that it has suitable controls in place and that they are operating effectively over time.

Security (mandatory)
Availability
Processing Integrity
Confidentiality
Privacy

Used For
Marketing
Publishing on website
Easy proof of security posture
CISSP GRC Tie‑In:  Used for governance transparency and stakeholder assurance, but not acceptable for vendor risk assessments.

SOC 1 is Financial reporting controls (ICFR) for Auditors, CFO, regulators
SOC 2 focuses on security, availability, confidentiality, integrity, privacy. need registered CPA firms/CPAs to conduct audits and issue reports for **security and customer teams** ....
SOC 3 for Public summary of SOC 2 for giving to Public, marketing, customers

 SOC 1 vs SOC 2
Your organization is evaluating a payroll vendor that processes financial transactions. Which report provides the MOST relevant assurance?
✔ Correct Answer: SOC 1 Type II
➡ CISSP Logic:
Financial reporting = SOC 1.
Assurance = Type II.
 
 CISSP Exam Traps to Avoid
❌ Trap 1: “SOC 1 is about security”
No — SOC 1 = financial.
❌ Trap 2: “SOC 3 is enough for due diligence”
Never. It is not acceptable for risk assessments.
❌ Trap 3: “Type I is as strong as Type II”
Type II is always stronger.
❌ Trap 4: “SOC reports certify security”
They do not certify. They attest.
❌ Trap 5: “SOC 2 always includes all TSC”
Only Security is mandatory.

As such, its primary focus is on specifying the requirements for records management systems. 
 
   specific standards for business continuity are the ISO 22301 series.
  
 
  The ISO 31004 standard provides guidelines on implementing risk management processes and protocols. This is the most important principle of this standard, as it is designed specifically to assist organizations in managing risk effectively. It details how to integrate risk management into a company's decision-making process, the elements of a risk management framework, how to evaluate the effectiveness of risk management, and how to continually improve risk management
  
   To establish a standard for the certification of information security management systems: ISO/IEC 27006 specifically provides guidelines for the bodies providing audit and certification of an information security management system (ISMS), as described in ISO/IEC 27001. Essentially, it gives a standardized approach for ISMS certification, ensuring consistent and reliable assessments
  
  ISO/IEC 27006 is more centered on the guidelines for audit and certification bodies
  
  ISO/IEC 27005-  To provide a framework for information security risk management
 
 
  ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 - To establish a common framework for the life cycle of systems engineering and software engineering
 It is a standard that applies to the system and software life cycles, including processes and process descriptions. It provides a common framework that enables understanding and communication among all stakeholders involved in a project. It does this by detailing the stages of the lifecycle from concept and initial requirements, through design, build, test, operation, and maintenance, to final decommissioning.
