Capability Table: If Thor is assigning read access to a group of files and can organize the users into five departments, using a capability table would be the most likely mechanism. A capability table is a system used to define access rights based on capabilities, which are tokens or keys that grant permissions to users or groups to access specific system objects such as files. Since Thor is dealing with several hundred employees, it would be more efficient to manage access by assigning capabilities to departments, rather than managing individual file permissions for each user. The incorrect answers: Access Control List: While ACLs are a common method for controlling access to files based on user identities and group memberships, they are not as suited to scenarios with a large number of users where permissions are uniform across common objects. ACLs could become complex and cumbersome to manage with several hundred individual entries. Content-dependent access controls: This form of access control relies on the content within the objects to determine access, rather than predefined capabilities or groups. This would not be the most efficient method for Thor, as he is looking to assign access based on departmental grouping, not content evaluation. Application access control: Although application access control could theoretically be used to govern access to certain files within an application, it is not the most likely choice for managing file access at an organizational or departmental level across multiple applications or systems. Application access controls are more specific to the functions within the application itself.

Authorization comes after authentication. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or device. It often involves checking a username and password, or some other form of credentials. Authorization comes after a user or system is authenticated. It involves granting permissions to the authenticated user or system, determining what they can access and what actions they can perform. The incorrect answers: Authentication is granting permissions: This is incorrect. Authentication is about verifying identity, not granting permissions. Authorization is verifying the identity of a user: This is incorrect. Authorization is about granting access and permissions, not verifying identity. Authorization comes before authentication: This is incorrect. Authentication usually comes before authorization. You need to know who someone is (authentication) before you can decide what they can do (authorization).

EER/FAR/CER
High FRR (False Rejection Rate): When deploying biometric access readers for areas labeled as critical security, setting the sensitivity to a high FRR is advisable. A high FRR means that the system is more stringent in its authentication process, leading to a lower chance of false acceptance (FAR), which is paramount in high-security areas. The trade-off with a high FRR is that legitimate users might occasionally be denied access and have to go through additional steps to authenticate, but this is acceptable in environments where security is the top priority. The incorrect answers: High FAR (False Accept Rate): A high FAR is not desirable in any security context, especially not in critical security areas, as it would mean a higher risk of unauthorized access being granted. Low CER (Crossover Error Rate): While a low CER indicates a good balance between FAR and FRR, in high-security areas, the priority is to minimize the chance of unauthorized access, which could mean accepting a higher FRR. Exactly at the CER (Crossover Error Rate): Setting the sensitivity exactly at the CER means equating FAR and FRR rates, which is not the most secure option for critical security areas. The focus should be on minimizing the risk of unauthorized access, typically by accepting a higher FRR.
The Equal Error Rate (EER) is the best indicator of the accuracy of a biometric system. It is the point where both the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are equal. The lower the EER, the better the system is considered to be because it means the biometric system makes fewer mistakes in both falsely accepting an imposter and falsely rejecting an authorized user. The incorrect answers: While False Acceptance Rate (FAR) is an important metric for a biometric system, it only measures the likelihood of the system incorrectly accepting an access attempt by an unauthorized user. It does not take into account the system's ability to correctly identify authorized users, which is why it is not the best overall indicator of accuracy. Similar to FAR, the False Rejection Rate (FRR) only measures one aspect of a biometric system's performance: the likelihood of the system incorrectly rejecting an access attempt by an authorized user. While it's an important metric, it's not the best overall indicator of accuracy because it doesn't consider the system's performance in correctly rejecting unauthorized users. Crossing Error Rate (CER): This is a commonly mistaken term. The correct term is Crossover Error Rate (CER), which is essentially another term for Equal Error Rate.

Delegated Identity Management (DIM): Delegated Identity Management refers to a scenario where authentication is performed by one service but is trusted and accepted by another. In John's case, he is using his Facebook identity to log into the store online, which constitutes a delegation of the authentication process. The online store trusts Facebook to verify John's identity and does not require him to create a new account and password for their site. The incorrect answers: Single Sign-On (SSO): Single Sign-On is a user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. However, SSO is generally used within the same organization or suite of services, rather than leveraging an external identity provider like Facebook. Federated Identity Management (FIM): Federated Identity Management is a system that links and manages the identity information across multiple autonomous systems or domains. While FIM encompasses the use of shared identities across different domains, the term "federated" usually implies a more mutual and cooperative arrangement, which might not be what is directly intended by the term "Delegated Identity Management." Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS): AD DS is a directory service for Windows domain networks and is not typically used for consumers logging into unrelated online stores. It is more focused on internal network authentication and directory services within an enterprise environment.

A cloud-based identity service: Given the requirements to minimize infrastructure, management overhead, and rapidly deploy the solution, a cloud-based identity service would be the best choice for Natalie. Cloud-based identity services can provide authentication for both on-premise and cloud-based services without the need for additional infrastructure. They are managed by the service provider, which reduces the overhead for Natalie's company, and can typically be deployed quickly. The incorrect answers: A federated identity solution: While federated identity solutions allow for single sign-on across different systems and can potentially work with cloud services, they may require more infrastructure and management overhead compared to a fully cloud-based identity service, especially if the federated solution is managed on-premise. An on-premise authentication solution: An on-premise solution would likely require significant infrastructure and ongoing management, which does not align with Natalie's goal to minimize infrastructure and overhead. A third-party identity service: This kind of service could potentially meet the requirements, but it is less specific than a cloud-based identity service. Third-party identity services could be either on-premise or cloud-based, so without more context, it's harder to assert that it would be the best solution compared to a clearly defined cloud-based identity service.

Object, subject. In the context of an access request, the "subject" is the entity that is making the request or performing an action, which is Francis in this scenario. The "object" is the entity that the action is performed on or that is being requested, which in this case is the "Tuna Notes" file. The incorrect answers: Subject, object: This is the inverse of the correct relationship. In this scenario, "Tuna Notes" is the object, not the subject, and Francis is the subject, not the object. Active entity, passive entity: While these terms could be used to describe a similar relationship, they are less commonly used in this context than "subject" and "object." Passive entity, active entity: This is the inverse of the active/passive relationship and is less commonly used than "subject" and "object."
The correct answer:

Multi-factor authentication, strong access controls, strong authorization controls, and encryption. For protecting Secret-level information, multiple layers of security are needed to ensure only authorized users can access the file and that the data remains protected even if credentials are compromised. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) verifies user identity through multiple factors, access and authorization controls ensure permissions align with role and clearance, and encryption protects the data at rest and in transit. Together, these controls provide defense in depth against unauthorized access.

Accountability: Accountability ensures that actions taken on a system can be attributed to an identified individual or entity, which provides assurance that only authorized users are accessing the system and using it properly. It involves the ability to track user activities and to hold users responsible for their actions, typically through logging and monitoring mechanisms. The incorrect answers: Authentication: While authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting access to a system, by itself, it does not provide assurance that the system is being used properly after access has been granted. Authorization: Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do within a system, such as what resources they can access and what actions they can perform. It does not, however, track or record what the user actually does, which is necessary for accountability. Auditing: Auditing is the process of reviewing and analyzing records of system activities to ensure compliance with policies and procedures. While auditing is closely related to accountability and is often used to measure it, the term 'accountability' directly refers to the concept of users being answerable for their actions on the system.

Rule-based access control. Rule-based access control (RuBAC) does not primarily use the characteristics of the subject (the user or process requesting access) or the object (the resource being accessed) to grant or deny access. Instead, rule-based access control uses a set of pre-established security rules that govern access rights. The rules can include various conditions such as time of day, location, type of connection, etc. For example, a rule might specify that no one can access a particular system outside of business hours. The incorrect answers: Role-based access control: Role-based access control (RBAC) is based on the roles that individual users take on in a system. Under this model, users are granted access rights based on their role, which in turn is linked to the tasks they are expected to perform. This model is therefore inherently linked to the characteristics of the 'subject' (the user) in the authorization process. Attribute-based access control: Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is a model that grants access rights based on attributes associated with the user, the resource being accessed, and current environmental conditions. Both subject (user) and object (resource) attributes are central to this model of access control. Discretionary access control: In Discretionary Access Control (DAC), the data owner decides who can access specific resources. This access can be granted based on user identity or on the basis of rules that have been established by the user, so it can be argued that both subjects and objects play a role in this type of access control.



The incorrect answers:

Strong authorization controls, strong access controls, and detailed audit logs: Audit logs help detect unauthorized activity but don’t prevent it, making this option incomplete.

Strong authorization controls, enforcing the principle of need to know, and enforcing the principle of least privilege: These are sound administrative principles but lack technical enforcement mechanisms like encryption or MFA.

Strong authorization controls, strong access controls, and encryption: This is close but misses the added assurance provided by multi-factor authentication, which is critical for protecting sensitive or classified data.

Dual control, sometimes referred to as "two-person control" or "two-man rule," is a security principle that ensures that no single individual can access or use certain critical assets or perform high-risk tasks alone. This principle requires the presence or participation of two authorized individuals to execute certain actions, which drastically reduces the potential for malicious insider activity, fraud, or unintentional mistakes that can compromise security. By necessitating a second person, the chance of a single individual compromising a system or data is diminished. 

IAAA
vailability refers to the ability for a system or resource to be accessible and functioning properly. It is not a part of the IAAA model, which stands for Identity, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability/Auditing. It is generally considered part of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) model of information security. The incorrect answers: Authentication is indeed one of the A's in the IAAA model. It refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. It usually involves a username and password, but can also involve other methods like biometrics or smart cards. Authorization is another one of the A's in the IAAA model. It refers to the process of granting or denying access to specific resources once a user, device, or system has been authenticated. Auditing, also known as Accountability, refers to the process of monitoring and recording the actions and activities of users within a system. It is a part of the IAAA model.

The correct answer: Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is designed for environments that require high security and strict control over data access. This model enforces access control based on security classifications and clearances, and is typically used in military or governmental agencies, making it suitable for a corporation operating in a highly regulated industry. The incorrect answers: Discretionary Access Control (DAC) can provide flexibility, but it can also lead to inconsistencies and potential security risks if not properly managed. Data owners may not always make decisions in line with corporate security policies or regulatory requirements, and this model does not offer the rigorous control needed in highly regulated industries. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is widely used and suitable for many organizations, but it may lack the granular control necessary in highly regulated industries where access needs to be tightly controlled, and compartmentalized based on specific clearances and categories of data. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) can provide granular control based on multiple attributes (including the user's role, department, time of day, location, and even the type of transaction), but it can be complex to implement and manage. It may not offer the same level of stringent, compartmentalized control as the MAC model in highly regulated industries.

Federated access control relies on the concept of trust between different organizations or domains. In this model, a user's authentication process in one domain is trusted by another domain without the need to re-authenticate when accessing resources. A trusted third party (often an identity provider) vouches for or authenticates the user, and other entities (service providers) trust this authentication. A common example is Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions across different web services. The incorrect answers: Role-based access control (RBAC) is an approach where permissions are assigned to specific roles, and users are assigned roles. It's not based on the concept of a trusted third party for authentication. Instead, it centralizes permissions around roles within the system. In rule-based access control, access is granted or denied based on a set of rules, often defined by system policies. These rules can include aspects like time of day, the network source of a request, or other conditions. This model doesn't inherently rely on a trusted third party for authentication. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a method that requires a user to provide multiple types of credentials to authenticate their identity. This often includes something they know (like a password), something they have (like a smart card or a token), and something they are (like a fingerprint). MFA does not revolve around the concept of a trusted third party.

Verifying the identity of certificate holders: In a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system, RAs are responsible for verifying the identities of entities (e.g., individuals, organizations, or devices) before they are issued digital certificates by a Certificate Authority (CA). This process ensures that the digital certificates, which are used to establish secure communications and authenticate entities in a network, are issued to the correct and legitimate entities. The incorrect answers: Issuing digital certificates: This is primarily the role of a Certificate Authority (CA), not an RA. Although an RA assists in the process, the final issuance of a digital certificate is done by the CA. Providing support for certificate revocation: While an RA might assist in the certificate revocation process, it's the CA that holds the ultimate responsibility to revoke certificates when necessary. The RA can help identify instances where revocation may be needed, but the action of revocation itself is typically handled by the CA. Coordinating with other RAs: While it's true that RAs may need to coordinate with each other in large or complex systems, this is not their primary function. Their main role is to authenticate the identities of entities before a CA issues a certificate, ensuring the overall trustworthiness of the system.

An active detective control involves manual intervention, such as audits and reviews to identify and react to issues or irregularities
 The term "active" refers to the proactive nature of this process, while "detective" signifies its purpose of detecting potential issues
A Passive detective control: This type of control involves automated systems that detect and alert anomalies, errors, or potential security issues without human intervention. An example of a passive detective control could be an intrusion detection system (IDS) that continuously monitors network traffic for suspicious activity
An Active physical control: This type of control refers to physical measures that prevent unauthorized access to physical assets, like CCTV cameras, security personnel, or locked doors. It actively prevents incidents by existing as a physical barrier or deterrent.
Passive preventative control: These controls are designed to prevent an undesirable event from occurring, and they are typically "passive" in the sense that they don't require regular active human intervention. Examples of passive preventative controls are firewall systems, encryption, or user access controls
