SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
In this tutorial we will write all SQL keywords in upper-case.

Semicolon after SQL Statements?
Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

In this tutorial, we will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

Some of The Most Important SQL Commands
SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index
===========================================================
In SQL, rows and columns have very specific conceptual roles. The easiest way to understand them is to think of a SQL table as representing a set of entities, where:

Rows = individual records (entities)
Columns = attributes describing each record

Here’s how SQL formally defines and uses them:

🧱 Columns = Attributes / Fields / Data Types
A column defines:
✔ 1. The type of data stored
Each column has a data type (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATETIME).
It tells SQL how to store, index, compare, and validate values.
✔ 2. A named attribute of the entity
Example: In a Customers table, columns might be:

CustomerID
FirstName
Email
CreatedDate

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from.
The table_name represents the name of the table you want to select data from.
=========================================================================================
The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Select all the different countries from the "Customers" table:

SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

SELECT Example Without DISTINCT
If you omit the DISTINCT keyword, the SQL statement returns the "Country" value from all the records of the "Customers" table:

Example
SELECT Country FROM Customers;


The SQL WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Select all customers from Mexico:
========================================================================================
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';

Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields
SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).

However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;
Operators in The WHERE Clause
You can use other operators than the = operator to filter the search.

Example
Select all customers with a CustomerID greater than 80:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID > 80;
The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:

Operator	Description	Example
=	Equal	
>	Greater than	
<	Less than	
>=	Greater than or equal	
<=	Less than or equal	
<>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
LIKE	Search for a pattern	
IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column	


search names contains "An"

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName like'An%';

==========================================================================
The SQL ORDER BY
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Sort the products by price:

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY Price;

==========================================================================
The SQL ORDER BY
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Sort the products by price:

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY Price;
Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

DESC
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

Example
Sort the products from highest to lowest price:

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC;

Order Alphabetically
For string values the ORDER BY keyword will order alphabetically:

Example
Sort the products alphabetically by ProductName:

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY ProductName;  ....... ASC|DESC;

Alphabetically DESC
To sort the table reverse alphabetically, use the DESC keyword:

Example
Sort the products by ProductName in reverse order:

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY ProductName DESC;

ORDER BY Several Columns
The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted by the "Country" and the "CustomerName" column. This means that it orders by Country, but if some rows have the same Country, it orders them by CustomerName:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;

Using Both ASC and DESC
The following SQL statement selects all customers from the "Customers" table, sorted ascending by the "Country" and descending by the "CustomerName" column:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;

====================================================
The SQL AND Operator
The WHERE clause can contain one or many AND operators.

The AND operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Spain that starts with the letter 'G':

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Select all customers from Spain that starts with the letter 'G':

SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%';


Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

AND vs OR
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.

The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.

SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'G%' AND country like 'S%' OR country like 'B%' ;

All Conditions Must Be True
The following SQL statement selects all fields from Customers where Country is "Brazil" AND City is "Rio de Janeiro" AND CustomerID is higher than 50:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'
AND City = 'Rio de Janeiro'
AND CustomerID > 50;

Combining AND and OR
You can combine the AND and OR operators.

The following SQL statement selects all customers from Spain that starts with a "G" or an "R".
Make sure you use parenthesis to get the correct result.

Example
Select all Spanish customers that starts with either "G" or "R":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');

Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers from Spain that starts with a "G", plus all customers that starts with an "R", regardless of the country value:

Example
Select all customers that either:
are from Spain and starts with either "G", or
starts with the letter "R":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';

==========================================
The SQL OR Operator
The WHERE clause can contain one or more OR operators.

The OR operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Germany but also those from Spain:

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Select all customers from Germany or Spain:
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'Spain';

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

OR vs AND
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.

The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.

At Least One Condition Must Be True
The following SQL statement selects all fields from Customers where either City is "Berlin", CustomerName starts with the letter "G" or Country is "Norway":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'Berlin' OR CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR Country = 'Norway';

Combining AND and OR
You can combine the AND and OR operators.

The following SQL statement selects all customers from Spain that starts with a "G" or an "R".

Make sure you use parenthesis to get the correct result.

Example
Select all Spanish customers that starts with either "G" or "R":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');

======================================================================================
The NOT Operator
The NOT operator is used in combination with other operators to give the opposite result, also called the negative result.

In the select statement below we want to return all customers that are NOT from Spain:

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Select only the customers that are NOT from Spain:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country = 'Spain';
In the example above, the NOT operator is used in combination with the = operator, but it can be used in combination with other comparison and/or logical operators. See examples below.

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;

NOT LIKE
Example
Select customers that does not start with the letter 'A':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'A%';

NOT BETWEEN
Example
Select customers with a customerID not between 10 and 60:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 60;

Example
Select customers that are not from Paris or London:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT IN ('Paris', 'London');

NOT Greater Than
Example
Select customers with a CustomerId not greater than 50:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT CustomerID > 50;

NOT Less Than
Example
Select customers with a CustomerID not less than 50:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT CustomerId < 50;

===============================================================
The SQL INSERT INTO Statement
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.

INSERT INTO Syntax
It is possible to write the INSERT INTO statement in two ways:

1. Specify both the column names and the values to be inserted:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

2. If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. Here, the INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

insert into customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
values ('Chet Anderson', 'Jonny Anderson', '4565 Sunnyside st', 'Newark','91763','USA');

INSERT INTO Example
The following SQL statement inserts a new record in the "Customers" table:

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');
The selection from the "Customers" table will now look like this:

Insert Data Only in Specified Columns
It is also possible to only insert data in specific columns.

The following SQL statement will insert a new record, but only insert data in the "CustomerName", "City", and "Country" columns (CustomerID will be updated automatically):

Example
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');

Insert Multiple Rows
It is also possible to insert multiple rows in one statement.

To insert multiple rows of data, we use the same INSERT INTO statement, but with multiple values:

Example
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES
('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway'),
('Greasy Burger', 'Per Olsen', 'Gateveien 15', 'Sandnes', '4306', 'Norway'),
('Tasty Tee', 'Finn Egan', 'Streetroad 19B', 'Liverpool', 'L1 0AA', 'UK');

Make sure you separate each set of values with a comma ,.

====================================================================================
SQL NULL Values
What is a NULL Value?
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.

Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!

How to Test for NULL Values?
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.

We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

IS NULL Syntax
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

IS NOT NULL Syntax
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

The IS NOT NULL Operator
The IS NOT NULL operator is used to test for non-empty values (NOT NULL values).

The following SQL lists all customers with a value in the "Address" field:

Example
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address
FROM Customers
WHERE Address IS NOT NULL;

=========================================================================================
The SQL UPDATE Statement
The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE Syntax
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

Note: Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!

UPDATE Table
The following SQL statement updates the first customer (CustomerID = 1) with a new contact person and a new city.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;

UPDATE Multiple Records
It is the WHERE clause that determines how many records will be updated.

The following SQL statement will update the ContactName to "Juan" for all records where country is "Mexico":

Example
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Juan'
WHERE Country='Mexico';


Update Warning! 
Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!

Example  ... NO NONONONONONO
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Juan';

==============================================================================================
The SQL DELETE Statement
The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

DELETE Syntax
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!

SQL DELETE Example
The following SQL statement deletes the customer "Alfreds Futterkiste" from the "Customers" table:

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';

Delete All Records
It is possible to delete all rows in a table without deleting the table. This means that the table structure, attributes, and indexes will be intact:

DELETE FROM table_name;

The following SQL statement deletes all rows in the "Customers" table, without deleting the table:

Example
DELETE FROM Customers;
Delete a Table
To delete the table completely, use the DROP TABLE statement:

Example
Remove the Customers table:

DROP TABLE Customers;

===========================================================================================
The SQL SELECT TOP Clause
The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Select only the first 3 records of the Customers table:

SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;

Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.

SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:

SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

MySQL Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;

Oracle 12 Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name(s)
FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;

Older Oracle Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE ROWNUM <= number;

Older Oracle Syntax (with ORDER BY):

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name(s))
WHERE ROWNUM <= number;

IMIT
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:

Example
Select the first 3 records of the Customers table:

SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;
FETCH FIRST
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:

Example
Select the first 3 records of the Customers table:

SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;

ADD a WHERE CLAUSE
The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany" (for SQL Server/MS Access):

Example
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany';
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
LIMIT 3;
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
FETCH FIRST 31 ROWS ONLY;

ADD the ORDER BY Keyword
Add the ORDER BY keyword when you want to sort the result, and return the first 3 records of the sorted result.

For SQL Server and MS Access:

Example
Sort the result reverse alphabetically by CustomerName, and return the first 3 records:

SELECT TOP 31 * FROM Customers
ORDER BY CustomerName DESC;

=============================================
n aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.

Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement. The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.

The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:

MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column
MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column
COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set
SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column
AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column
Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT(*)).

==========================================================
SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions
The SQL MIN() and MAX() Functions
The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.

The MAX() function returns the largest value of the selected column.

MIN ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Find the lowest price in the Price column:

SELECT MIN(Price)
FROM Products;
MAX Example
Find the highest price in the Price column:

SELECT MAX(Price)
FROM Products;

Set Column Name (Alias)
When you use MIN() or MAX(), the returned column will not have a descriptive name. To give the column a descriptive name, use the AS keyword:

Example
SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
FROM Products;

Use MIN() with GROUP BY
Here we use the MIN() function and the GROUP BY clause, to return the smallest price for each category in the Products table:

Example
SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice, CategoryID
FROM Products
GROUP BY CategoryID;

===============================================
The SQL COUNT() Function
The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Find the total number of rows in the Products table:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Products;

Syntax
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Specify Column
You can specify a column name instead of the asterix symbol (*).

If you specify a column name instead of (*), NULL values will not be counted.

Example
Find the number of products where the ProductName is not null:

SELECT COUNT(ProductName)
FROM Products;

Add a WHERE Clause
You can add a WHERE clause to specify conditions:

Example
Find the number of products where Price is higher than 20:

SELECT COUNT(ProductID)
FROM Products
WHERE Price > 20;
===================================================================
The SQL OR Operator
The WHERE clause can contain one or more OR operators.

The OR operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition, like if you want to return all customers from Germany but also those from Spain:

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Select all customers from Germany or Spain:

SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'Spain';

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

OR vs AND
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.

At Least One Condition Must Be True
The following SQL statement selects all fields from Customers where either City is "Berlin", CustomerName starts with the letter "G" or Country is "Norway":

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'Berlin' OR CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR Country = 'Norway';

Combining AND and OR
You can combine the AND and OR operators.

The following SQL statement selects all customers from Spain that starts with a "G" or an "R".

Make sure you use parenthesis to get the correct result.

Example
Select all Spanish customers that starts with either "G" or "R":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');

Without parenthesis, the select statement will return all customers from Spain that starts with a "G", plus all customers that starts with an "R", regardless of the country value:

Example
Select all customers that either:
are from Spain and starts with either "G", or
starts with the letter "R":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';
===================================================================================
SQL Wildcard Characters
A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.

Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Return all customers that starts with the letter 'a':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';

Wildcard Characters
Symbol	Description
%	Represents zero or more characters
_	Represents a single character
[]	Represents any single character within the brackets *
^	Represents any character not in the brackets *
-	Represents any single character within the specified range *
{}	Represents any escaped character **

Using the % Wildcard
The % wildcard represents any number of characters, even zero characters.

Example
Return all customers that ends with the pattern 'es':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%es';

Example
Return all customers that contains the pattern 'mer':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%mer%';

Using the _ Wildcard
The _ wildcard represents a single character.
It can be any character or number, but each _ represents one, and only one, character.

Example
Return all customers with a City starting with any character, followed by "ondon":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City LIKE '_ondon';

Using the [] Wildcard
The [] wildcard returns a result if any of the characters inside gets a match.

Example
Return all customers starting with either "b", "s", or "p":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '[bsp]%';

Using the - Wildcard
The - wildcard allows you to specify a range of characters inside the [] wildcard.

Example
Return all customers starting with "a", "b", "c", "d", "e" or "f":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '[a-f]%';

Combine Wildcards
Any wildcard, like % and _ , can be used in combination with other wildcards.

Example
Return all customers that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';

Example
Return all customers that have "r" in the second position:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%';
Without Wildcard
If no wildcard is specified, the phrase has to have an exact match to return a result.

Example
Return all customers from Spain:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country LIKE 'Spain';



Microsoft Access Wildcards
The Microsoft Access Database has some other wildcards:

Symbol	Description	Example
*	Represents zero or more characters	bl* finds bl, black, blue, and blob
?	Represents a single character	h?t finds hot, hat, and hit
[]	Represents any single character within the brackets	h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
!	Represents any character not in the brackets	h[!oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-	Represents any single character within the specified range	c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
#	Represents any single numeric character	2#5 finds 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, and 295

================================================
The SQL IN Operator
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Return all customers from 'Germany', 'France', or 'UK'

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);

NOT IN
By using the NOT keyword in front of the IN operator, you return all records that are NOT any of the values in the list.

Example
Return all customers that are NOT from 'Germany', 'France', or 'UK':

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

IN (SELECT)
You can also use IN with a subquery in the WHERE clause.

With a subquery you can return all records from the main query that are present in the result of the subquery.

Example
Return all customers that have an order in the Orders table:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);

NOT IN (SELECT)
The result in the example above returned 74 records, that means that there are 17 customers that haven't placed any orders.

Let us check if that is correct, by using the NOT IN operator.

Example
Return all customers that have NOT placed any orders in the Orders table:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID NOT IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);


USE [AdventureWorksDW2022]
