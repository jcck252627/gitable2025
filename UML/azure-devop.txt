can you give example of UML components diagram with some example Azure in a DevOps infrastructure ?

Below is a clean, realistic UML Component Diagram example for an Azure-based DevOps Infrastructure, showing how CI/CD, repos, pipelines, monitoring, and cloud resources interact.
I will also include a Mermaid version so you can render it immediately.

✅ UML Component Diagram — Azure DevOps Infrastructure Example
Scenario:

A company uses Azure DevOps for CI/CD, Azure Repos for code, Azure Pipelines for build + release, and Azure resources such as AKS, App Service, Key Vault, and Log Analytics.

📌 UML Component Diagram (Conceptual)

Components:

Azure DevOps

Azure Repos

Azure Pipelines (CI & CD)

Azure Artifacts

Azure Cloud

Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure App Service

Azure SQL

Azure Key Vault

Azure Monitor / Log Analytics

Developers

Developer Workstation / IDE (VS Code)

Interactions:

Developers commit code to Azure Repos

Azure Pipeline (CI) builds + tests, pushes images to ACR

Azure Pipeline (CD) deploys to AKS / App Service

Workloads pull secrets from Key Vault

Logs forwarded to Log Analytics
