CISSP Study Resources
Material and Resources pursing CISSP Certification!

CISSP Study Resources is a collection of study and reference materials and my notes gathered as I worked towards certification. I passed the exam at 100 questions in April 2025, but I want to continue to improve and add value to this resource to make your certification process easier.

Because there is so much material available, it can be a bit daunting to know where to begin, and what really merits your time and effort. No compilation is exhaustive, but my goal is to gather information that will be useful and encouraging to you as you undertake this effort. At the least, it provides a list of resources, tests, and reference material to review.

The study guides below have been updated for 2025, and now follow the (ISC)² updated objectives and the 10th edition of the Official Study Guide.

Feel free to share this repo or any of the resources if you find them useful. Tell me about mistakes or improvements you think should be made! Connect with me on LinkedIn.
